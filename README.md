## Aim

I am looking to build my frontend skills by working on real-world projects.  

## Process

For a good chunk of the projects I opt to use vanilla CSS and JS to test my knowledge of core principles. However, as I progress and pick up new technologies, I also flex them here to test my understanding and their capabilities.
