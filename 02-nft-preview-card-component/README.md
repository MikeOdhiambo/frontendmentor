## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

For this project I practiced my skills on CSS custom properties and the mobile-first approach. I also wanted to challenge my Vanilla CSS knowledge, without using any frameworks or libraries.
